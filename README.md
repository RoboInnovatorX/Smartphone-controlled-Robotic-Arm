# Smartphone-controlled-Robotic-Arm

This GitHub repository hosts the code for an ESP32-based robotic arm control project. The microcontroller, programmed in C++, enables precise control of servo motors, allowing users to perform desired actions through the ESP32's integrated elements. The project leverages Wi-Fi technology, providing convenient control through a web application.
